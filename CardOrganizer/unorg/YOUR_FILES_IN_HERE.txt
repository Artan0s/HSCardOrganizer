This is where you put the cards you want to organize. The foldername stands for "unorg"anized cards.
The program can deal with 2 states of cards:
1. Standalone cards - Those are just .png cards inside this folder.
2. Multi cards		- Those are folders, in which there is a card with the same name. This is for the case your card has tokens.

Examples:
The card "Early Payment" will be put in "../00Rogue/3 Epics/".
The card "Sparkle Flask" will be put in "../00Mage/2 Rares/Sparkle Flask/", along with its token.
